# I know I settled on AfterStep (1.x) or WindowMaker on DEC UNIX,
# for some reason CDE wasn't available, or at least I have no
# memory of ever running it except on Solaris at Nada

# FVWM/2/95
# I do remember playing around with fvwm, fvwm2, fvwm95(!), twm/mwm(?).
# I cannot find any of these dotfiles but there is a fvwm2 config found on
# the KTH AFS cell here.
# setenv WINDOW_MANAGER fvwm2

# CDE
# I did eventually find some CDE settings and old sessions on DEC UNIX,
# so I must have run that at some time. Please see the .dt.digital folder here.
# I know I ran CDE almost all the time on Solaris. I did find some WindowMaker
# config files in my old Solaris home so I must have played around with that too.
