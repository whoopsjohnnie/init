# This file sources a system-wide .login file, which:
#      - presumes that the .cshrc file has been sourced
#      - performs standard setups appropriate for tty session
#      - runs standard startup activities (e.g., check mail)
#      - source user file ~/.startup.tty, if it exists

# If you want to ADJUST the login initialization sequence, create a
# .startup.tty file in your home directory, with commands to run activities
# once the environment has been set up (znol, emacs, etc.).

# To adjust the environment initialization sequence, see the instructions in
# the .bashrc file.

# If you want to CHANGE the login initialization sequence, revise this .bash_login
# file (the one you're reading now).  You may want to copy the contents of
# the system-wide login file as a starting point.
#
# WARNING: If you revise this .bash_login file, you will not automatically
# get any changes that may be made to the system-wide file at 
# a later date.  Be sure you know what you are doing.
