# Set the decoration styles and window options
# Order is important!!!!
# If compatible styles are set for a single window in multiple Style
# commands, then the styles are ORed together. If conflicting styles
# are set, the last one specified is used.
#
# These commands should command before any menus or functions are defined,
# and before the internal pager is started.
