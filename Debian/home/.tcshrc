# Prototype user .tcshrc file
# Last modified by patriks/910730

# This file sources a system-wide tcshrc file, which:
#      - sets up standard environment variables
#      - sources user file ~/.environment, if it exists
#      - sets standard path, OR sources user file ~/.path, if it exists
#      - sets up standard cshell variables, aliases, etc.
#      - source user file ~/.tshrc.mine, if it exists

# If you want to ADJUST the cshell initialization sequence, create any of 
# the following files (as appropriate) in your home directory, with commands
# to achieve the effect listed:
#
#      .environment - setup session environment (set environmental variables, 
#                     attach lockers, etc.)
#      .tcshrc.mine - setup cshell environment (set shell variables, aliases,
#                     unset system defaults, etc.)
                      
# If you want to CHANGE the cshell initialization sequence, revise this .tcshrc
# file (the one you're reading now).  You may want to copy the contents of
# the system-wide tcshrc file as a starting point.
#
# WARNING: If you revise this .tcshrc file, you will not automatically
# get any changes that may be made to the system-wide file at 
# a later date.  Be sure you know what you are doing.
